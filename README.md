# Aqua-Hunters

## MVP

## Server (Back End)
Have a RESTful JSON API.
Build a Ruby on Rails server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
Build a database with at least 3 tables:
There must be at least 1 association between your tables. (1:m or m:m)
Utilize Rails to define models for interacting with the database.
Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD (index, show, create, update, delete) between your non-User tables
Note that if you choose to do Authentication, CRUD on your User table does not count toward this requirement.

## Client (Front End)
Have a working, interactive React app, built using npx create-react-app.
Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
Utilize functional or class React components appropriately.
Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
Consume data from your Ruby on Rails API, and render that data in your components.
Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
Demonstrate Full CRUD actions ( index, show, create, update, and delete ) on the front end.
Note that if you decide to implement Auth, your full CRUD actions must be covered amongst your non-User tables.
